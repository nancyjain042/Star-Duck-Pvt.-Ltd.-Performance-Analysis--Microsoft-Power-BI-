## Project Overview: 
The Star Duck Toy Sales Dashboard is designed to offer a comprehensive data analysis and visualization of toy sales in significant cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York for the years 2020 and 2021. Its primary objective is to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into sales patterns, identify trends, and empower data-driven decision-making to optimize the toy business.

## Dataset Overview:
The dataset utilized for this project comprises sales data for Star Duck toys, encompassing the following columns:

Date: The date of the sale

Product Category: The category to which the toy belongs

Product Name: The specific name of the toy

Region: The geographical region where the sale took place

Store: The store where the toy was sold

Store Type: The type of store (e.g., retail, online)

Units Sold: The number of units of the toy sold

## Key Objectives:
The primary goals of the Star Duck Toy Sales Dashboard project are as follows:

Sales Analysis: Provide an overview of total sales, sales trends, and seasonality.

Product Performance: Analyze the performance of different product categories and specific toy products.

Regional Analysis: Explore sales variations across Chicago, Los Angeles, and New York.

Store Type Comparison: Compare sales between different types of stores (e.g., retail vs. online).

Date Analysis: Identify significant date-related trends or seasonality.

## Data Processing Steps: 
To accomplish these objectives, the following data processing steps are undertaken:

**Data Import**: Import the sales dataset into Power BI.

**Data Cleaning**: Clean the data to address missing values, eliminate duplicates, and ensure data consistency.

**Data Modeling**: Create dimension tables for 'Region,' 'Store,' and 'Store Type.' Additionally, generate a 'Date' table using DAX functions to enhance date-related analysis.

**Data Transformation**: Apply transformations and calculations to the dataset to derive meaningful insights. For example, calculate total sales, create measures for sales trends, and compute product-specific metrics.

**Data Visualization**: Create a range of visualizations, including line charts, bar charts, and tables, to present the data in a comprehensible format.

## Key Insights: 
Based on the analysis of the dataset, the following insights have been derived:

**Dinosaur Figures Dominance**: Dinosaur figures alone accounted for a significant portion of the revenue, comprising 49.5% of the total revenue. This highlights the strong revenue-driving potential of dinosaur figures in the toy business.

**Los Angeles Outperformance**: Los Angeles exhibited superior performance compared to Chicago and New York, signifying its significance as a key market for Star Duck toys. Further investigation can uncover the exact reasons behind this success, potentially replicating it in other regions.

**Impressive Total Revenue**: The project generated a total revenue of $8.76 million, reflecting a substantial and successful operation in the toy industry. 

**Weekly Revenue Patterns**: Tuesday and Wednesday have shown strong performance in terms of weekly revenue, suggesting the possibility of targeted strategies on these days.
